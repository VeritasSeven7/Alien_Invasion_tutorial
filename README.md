# Alien_Invasion_tutorial
Alien Invasion tutorial from the python crash course v3 book. First project I've done in python!

First project and first time working with github. Please forgive the messiness and if I've overlooked some manners of pushing work from Pycharm to my repo.
Also I am always open to advice and pointers on stuff!
